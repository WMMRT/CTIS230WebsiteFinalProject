                This is a weed eater that is pushed akin to a pushing lawn mower. This isn't as mobile as a normal weed
                eater, but gets the job down.

            <p>
                This is your typical weed eater. Not as good as the previous one, but far mor mobile due to being
                carried, and being lightweight.

                This is your traditonal pushing lawn mower. It will allow us to reach tighter spots that the riding lawn
                mower would struggle to get.

                This is a main tool we will be using, and is the most efficient at getting most of the work done. The
                other stuff is to clean up what it can't get easily.
