        <h2 class="introH">About Us</h2>
        <p class="introP">
            Webster’s Lawn Maintenance LLC was founded in 2020 by Russell Webster, in Randleman, North Carolina. It was
            created for a web of reason (hehe). The founder, Russell Webster, was born on July 5th, 1998, and is now a 21-year
            college senior.
        
            The main mission of Webster’s Lawn Maintenance is to keep the lawns/yards of our customer
            cut, and well taken care off, so that they can have a good-looking yard without having to do the work by
            themselves. We also provide an avenue for homeowners that do not have the equipment, nor the funds to obtain
            equipment that is used for lawn upkeep.
