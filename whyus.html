        <h2 class="introH">Why Should You Choose Us?</h2>
        <p class="introP">
            As a small business, we can be far more focused on the demands and needs of our customers. Our response
            time to our customers can be way faster, and more direct as you will be the main focus of our business. We
            also allow for scheduling appointments completely online, something that other small businesses in the
            mowing industry do not seem to do.
        </p>
    
        <p class="introP">
            Our prices are competitive with our competitors, at $30 per hour, and we do not charge our customers for
            travel, as long as their residence is in Randolph County. When compared to the cost of owning your own
            equipment, plus keeping stored and maintained, we offer convenience to many that may need our services.
